# Description:
# Script to start/stop MTK Connect agent and testbench to create devices.
#
# The following variables must be set before running this script:
#
#  - MTK_CONNECT_DOMAIN: the URL domain for mtk-connect.
#  - MTK_CONNECT_USERNAME: the MTK Connect API key username.
#  - MTK_CONNECT_PASSWORD: the MTK Connect API key password.
#
# Optional variables:
#  - MTK_CONNECT_TESTBENCH: the name of the testbench to create in mtk-connect.
#  - MTK_CONNECT_TEST_ARTIFACT: what is being tested.
#  - MTK_CONNECT_TESTBENCH_USER: users email address limiting access to test
#  - MTK_CONNECT_CONTAINER_ONLY: if true, then only container will be used
#  - MTK_CONNECT_HOST_ONLY: if true, then only HOST will be supported.
#  - MTK_CONNECT_DEVICE_PREFIX: prefix for device name.
#    and access only to the host machine will be allowed.
#  - MTK_CONNECT_TUNNEL_PORT: ADB tunnel caller port in create-testbench (default 8555).
#  - MTK_CONNECT_TERMINAL_USER: login user for the HOST terminal; defaults to
#    the builder/jenkins fallback chain.
#  - MTK_CONNECT_TUNNEL_LIST: comma-separated name:port entries; each becomes
#    a raw TCP tunnel to the device host for the MTK Connect Tunnel client
#    (on adb devices the tunnels are attached to the dedicated
#    MTK_CONNECT_TUNNEL_DEVICE_NAME device when set, else to device 1).
#  - MTK_CONNECT_TUNNEL_DEVICE_NAME: with adb devices and a tunnel list, carry
#    the raw TCP tunnels on a dedicated host-only device with this name at
#    index 1 (adb devices shift to index 2..N+1) instead of the first adb
#    device.
#  - MTK_CONNECT_DEVICE_NAME_LIST: comma-separated device names overriding
#    "<MTK_CONNECT_DEVICE_PREFIX> <index>" per index.
#
# Example Usage:
# sudo \
#   MTK_CONNECT_DOMAIN=${MTK_CONNECT_DOMAIN} \
#   MTK_CONNECT_USERNAME=${MTK_CONNECT_USERNAME} \
#   MTK_CONNECT_PASSWORD=${MTK_CONNECT_PASSWORD} ./mtk_connect.sh
